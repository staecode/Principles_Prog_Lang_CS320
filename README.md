Python experience: second language I wrote on after Ruby, for personal projects and goofing off. Moved on to Java, C++ in school.

Class description: 300 level courses at Portland State University, Discussion of programming language principles (tokens, AST, acceptance 
                   cases.. the works!). We are using Python (mostly for the ease of string manipulation, I assume). Exercises mostly have
                   been processing strings for validation.
